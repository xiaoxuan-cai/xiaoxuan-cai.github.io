<p> an assistant professor at the <a href="https://stat.osu.edu/">the Statistics Department at Ohio State University</a>. I received my Ph.D. training in Biostatistics with <a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Dr. Forrest W. Crawford</a>, at the <a href="https://publichealth.yale.edu/biostat/"> School of Public Health</a> at Yale University. I received my postdoc training with <a href="https://www.lindavaleri.com/">Dr. Linda Valeri</a> at <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics">the Mailman School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics</a> at Columbia University. </p>
<p> My research is devoted to addressing statistical challenges and methodological problems in causal inference, missing data, mediation analysis, and machine learning. My work covers applications in intervention evaluation and trial design for outcomes subject to interference (e.g. infectious disease), as well as the analysis of multivariate time series of digital data from mobile devices. </p>
