<br>

<p> I am currently a 5th year Ph.D student working with <a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/"> Forrest W. Crawford </a>, in the <a href="https://publichealth.yale.edu/biostat/"> School of Public Health</a> at Yale University.</p>
<p> I am interested in developing statitical tools to solve realworld problems in epidemiology and public health.
My current research projects center around evaluating infectious disease outcomes, and use methods covering causal inference, survival analysis, non-parametric estimation. </p>
