### Research interests
My research is devoted to addressing statistical challenges and methodological problems in causal inference, missing data, mediation analysis, and machine learning. My work covers applications in intervention evaluation and trial design for outcomes subject to interference (e.g. infectious disease), as well as the analysis of multivariate time series of digital data from mobile devices.
