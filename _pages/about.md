I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics">the Department of Biostatistics</a>, Columbia University. In the fall of 2022, I will join the Statistics Department at Ohio State University <a href="https://stat.osu.edu/>as an Assistant Professor.

I received my Ph.D. training in Biostatistics with <a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Dr. Forrest W. Crawford</a>, at the <a href="https://publichealth.yale.edu/biostat/"> School of Public Health</a> at Yale University. I received my postdoc training in Biostatistics with <a href="https://www.lindavaleri.com/">Dr. Linda Valeri</a> at Columbia University.

### Education
- Ph.D in Biostatistics, Yale University (Advisor: Forrest W. Crawford)
- M.S in Biostatistics, Yale University (Advisor: Peter Aronow)
- B.S in Biology, Peking University

### Research interests
My research is devoted to addressing statistical challenges and methodological problems in causal inference, missing data, mediation analysis, and machine learning. My work covers applications in intervention evaluation and trial design for outcomes subject to interference (e.g. infectious disease), as well as the analysis of multivariate time series of digital data from mobile devices.
